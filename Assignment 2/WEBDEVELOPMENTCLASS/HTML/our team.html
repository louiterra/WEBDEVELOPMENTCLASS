        <h2><b><u><i>LUIS TERRAZAS</i></u></b></h2>
        <p>Luis Terrazas started taking pictures while living in Los Angeles, California. He would frequently visit Disneyland. His love of photography started when he followed many Instagram photographers. He wanted to take pictures just like them. It all started with a camera and a dream. It took a while for him to learn how to take good looking pictures and how to make them look even better on the computer. Now he is combining his love of photography and coding to bring you this website. All the pictures presented on this website were taken by him.</p>
